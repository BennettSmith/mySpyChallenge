# iSpyChallenge

This repository contains an Xcode project that is used as a starting point for the iSpy App programming challenge used.

The model objects for the app are provided, along with some sample data for use during the exercise. All data is maintained in an in-memory persistent store,and is reloaded each time the app is launched.
 
A helper class called PhotoController is provided to store and retrieve photos from a local directory.  The sample data set includes a number of challenges, each with a photo.

There are four users and six challenges in the sample data set.  The challenges are randomly assigned to users each time the sample data is loaded.

Your goal is to implement the "New Challenge" and "Near Me" tabs in the app.  Refer to the documentation provided earlier for details on the model objects and what functionality the user interface should include.

You will have 3 hours to work on the project.
